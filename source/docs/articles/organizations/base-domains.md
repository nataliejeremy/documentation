Pantheon Partners, Strategic Partners, Enterprise accounts, Resellers, and OEM Partners have the ability to replace `pantheon.io` as the base domain for each environment on every site they run or are developing on the platform.

The base development domain should be a subdomain of your marketing site, such as `sites.awesomeagency.com`. A newly created site named "supersite" will then have a development environment URLs of `dev-supersite.sites.awesomeagency.com`.  


## Request the Base Domain

From your Organization Dashboard, go to Support and open a ticket. Select **Pantheon One** as the ticket type, check **non site-related issue**, and use "Custom Base Domain for <Agency Name>" as the subject. The body of the ticket must state the base domain required on the site, like `sites.example.com`.

## Create a Wildcard CNAME Record

At your DNS provider, create a wildcard CNAME record pointing to our edge. If you go with `sites.example.com`, the record would need to be created as follows:

`*.sites.example.com` **CNAME** `edge.live.getpantheon.com`

## Effects and Considerations

Sites associated with your organization will receive the custom base URL for all environments (including Multidev) created while the organization remains a supporting organization. If the supporting organization is removed from the team, new environments will receive URLs following the default `.pantheon.io` pattern. This includes new Multidev environments and Test and Live environments created **after** the organization was removed.

**Environment URLs are permanent.** If an organization is removed as the supporting organization, any environment created during its association will keep the original URL after removal. Paid sites can add custom domains to any environment, as a workaround for those wishing to use different URL's after launch and disassociation of the site with the organization.

## Robots.txt with Custom Base Domains

For SEO and to prevent duplicate content, the robots.txt file attached to the custom base domain will contain the following by default:

```
# http://live-sitename.agencyname.com/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```
To present an alternate robots.txt file from within the source code, a custom domain needs to be [added to the site's Dashboard](/docs/articles/sites/domains#step-2-add-a-domain-to-a-site-environment) and the appropriate DNS record created.
